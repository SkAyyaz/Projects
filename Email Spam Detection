# Step 1: Import Libraries
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Step 2: Sample Dataset (Small and Easy to Test)
data = {
    "Message": [
        "Congratulations! You've won a lottery. Claim your prize now!",
        "This is your last chance to earn $1000. Act now!",
        "Hi, can we schedule a meeting tomorrow?",
        "Don't forget to submit your assignment before 5 PM.",
        "Earn money quickly by clicking this link!",
        "Hey, how are you doing today?",
    ],
    "Label": ["spam", "spam", "ham", "ham", "spam", "ham"],
}

# Step 3: Prepare the Dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df["Message"]
y = df["Label"].map({"ham": 0, "spam": 1})  # Convert labels to 0 (ham) and 1 (spam)

# Step 4: Feature Extraction
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)

# Step 5: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vectorized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 6: Train the Model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 7: Take User Input
user_input = input("Enter an email message to check if it's spam or not: ")

# Step 8: Preprocess and Predict
user_vector = vectorizer.transform([user_input])
prediction = model.predict(user_vector)

# Step 9: Output the Result
if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("The email is SPAM.")
else:
    print("The email is NOT SPAM.")
